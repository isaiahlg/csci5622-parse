'let\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \nlet\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \nnow let\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\'s worth . \nwouldn\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\'s not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) ," and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \"" investments \"" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors ", while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\'s running time . \nluckily , it\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n',pos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . \nthe groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen\'t see a shadow , it will be an early spring . \nphil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . \nhowever , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . \ngroundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . \nthe screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . \nalthough the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . \nramis\'s direction also helps , and although he dosen\'t try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . \nand the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . \nthe performances are also excellent . \nbill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . \nandie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . \nthere is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . \nchris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . \nthe supporting cast aren\'t bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . \nin fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . \noverall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . \nit almost seems perfect . \nhowever , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . \nalso , there\'s not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . \nbut these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . \noverall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . \nan excellent comedy . \noverall rating= ( \n',pos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"' \"" no man is an island "," \"" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil ", effectively summarizing the movie\'s themes . \nwhile hardly a great film , singer\'s ambitious adaptation of king\'s short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . \napt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . \n1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . \nbowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd\'s theory . \nbowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden\'s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . \nthe stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident ," todd\'s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . \nbowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . \nmarching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his \"" student \"" ", among other things . \nbowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . \ndussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . \nall of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material\'s excessive climax . \nsinger has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . \nhis the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal\'s tics and todd\'s golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . \napt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . \nthankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects\' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . \nsome scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer\'s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . \nmckellan\'s and renfro\'s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan\'s finely-tuned realization , i\'d like to single out renfro\'s daring work . \nhe isn\'t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn\'t do . \n ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) \nrenfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn\'t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . \nas guidance counsellor edward french ," \"" friend \"" schwimmer also deserves mention . \nhe wants to be the parent to todd that todd\'s own well-to-do folks are not ( todd ", like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil\'s blackening-heart even more apparent . \nbut one of the film\'s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . \nno man is an island ," indeed-we all have the capacity to make the \"" right \"" or the \"" wrong \"" choices . \nschwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . \n-october ", 1998 \n * the excellent collection king\'s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . \n',pos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'i rented this movie with very high hopes . \nthis movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . \nfirst of all , the casting for this film is great . \ntobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . \nthey play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . \nwith a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . \ntobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . \nwilliam h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife ," a \"" colored \"" person and his friends "," the \"" non-colored \"" ones . \nhe also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . \nhe does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . \njoan allen is equally great as betty parker ", the ideal tv mom . \nher character is the most ambitious . \nshe is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . \nher lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . \nas said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . \nhis character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . \nhis character is very confusing and he is not very believable . \nthis film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . \nthe movie is very provocative . \nit challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . \ni really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . \nthey demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . \nthe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . \nsome films are not meant to be that long . \npleasantville is one of those films . \nthis film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . \nfirst , they are amazed by the implementation of color . \nthen they want to have it . \nthen they do not want to . \nthen the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . \nthis is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . \nsome movies need a lot of time . \nsaving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . \nthis film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . \nlength is everything in films . \nif you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . \npleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . \noverall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . \ni went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . \ni left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . \nluckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . \nonly if it could have done in a shorter amount of time . \n',pos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker\'s adaptation of frank mccourt\'s memoir angela\'s ashes . \nmany dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . \ni\'m somewhere in between ," leaning strongly towards the latter . \nit\'s certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . \nbut i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams \"" i\'m important ! \"" \nmccourt\'s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900\'s ", a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . \nas he comments ," \"" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . \"" \nin ireland ", frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela\'s mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . \nshe helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . \npositions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . \nmeanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . \ntwo of frank\'s brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . \nas if the poverty and the suffering weren\'t intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . \ni imagine this doesn\'t sound like much of a plot . \nthat\'s probably because it isn\'t one . \nthese are people . \nthis is their story . \ndirector alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela\'s ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . \nthough the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . \nsupplementing parker\'s able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . \ncarlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . \nwe empathize with the guy , but we don\'t like or admire him . \nemily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . \nit is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . \nalso worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film\'s superb poster . \nit is breen\'s first feature film and he\'s extraordinary as young frank . \nnot unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character\'s soul through breen\'s sad eyes . \non the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela\'s ashes is a more decisive editor . \nwhile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . \nthe first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . \nthings pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . \n * spoiler warning ! \nskip next paragraph if in suspense ! * \nthe film\'s final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . \nwhat , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? \nhis mother doesn\'t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . \ni haven\'t read the book , but i\'m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i\'m suspicious . \nanother thing that\'s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i\'m sure , is also explained in the memoir . \nif seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela\'s ashes stands tall . \ndespite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder . \n',pos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \nin any case , the answer is no . \ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \nplease do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming ," what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \"" hummm \"" sound is all about . \nyou have been warned . \nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \nexciting ", scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \nwhen i compare it with last summer\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \nyou know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \nand guess what ? \nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \nno , this is mulder\'s time in the spotlight . \nby now ," you have heard of the scene where mulder \"" showers \"" independence day . \nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you "," let\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be \"" showering \"" godzilla instead . \nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \ncares ! ?

\n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots ," every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \"" big emotional scene \"" between godzilla attacks ? \nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie ", the x-files is . \nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ?

'i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn\'t . \ngeorge lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . \nthis is the first star wars film i\'ve seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . \nwhat is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . \nbasically , the film\'s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . \nqui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . \nwhen their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . \nqui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . \nanakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon\'s ship . \nhowever , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . \nmeanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit\'s end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . \nthere are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . \nthis does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . \nin all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . \ndespite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . \nfor starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . \nwhat a klutz ! \ngeorge lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . \nsecondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie\'s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . \nthis is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie\'s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . \nthe movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . \ni can\'t say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . \nhowever , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . \nnatalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . \nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . \njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . \ndespite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . \nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn\'t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . \nthe film is a treasure to look at . \nthe visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8\% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . \nnot since 1997\'s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . \nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick\'s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang\'s classic silent metropolis . \nhowever , all the sets are so original . \nthe original star wars movies can\'t even match the grandeur of this film\'s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . \nthe costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . \nwhether its queen amadala\'s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . \nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . \nas for john williams\' score , i don\'t think he\'s done one as complex or powerful since ? i can\'t even remember . \nit is as epic as his schindler\'s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . \nit includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . \nwhat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie ," one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . \nthere is very little to hate in the film : it\'s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . \nit is the best \"" fun \"" film and the best big-budget film out today ", most definitely . \n',pos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'i don\'t box with kid gloves . \ni don\'t play nice , i\'m not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . \ni consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . \nhowever , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . \nrigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time . \ni still , however , will not go easy on them . \nthey recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . \nin the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . \nwell , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . \nthe point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me . \nsure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable . \ndown with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber\'s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report . \nlike the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . \nthe best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . \na dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers\' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . \' \nin down with america , the line `roswell\' is highly absent . \nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn\'t care less about . \nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name\' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \nfor once , i don\'t have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l\'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \nit\'s almost as much fun as the film . \n',pos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \nokay , it isn\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \nbut , the thing is , it isn\'t . \nit\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \nbut the species series isn\'t about the lack of these elements . \nit\'s about how much it can get into one film . \nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\'s needs . \nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \nof course , he isn\'t the first ever . \nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \nno life lives on it . \nthat is , no visible life . \npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\'t even remember . \nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \nhowever , this time around ," most of her \"" alien \"" urges have been either decreased dramatically ", or lie dormant . \nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \nand it has . \nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \nand it does it quite well . \nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\'s head being blown off . \nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \nhowever , i tend to disagree . \nwhat were the alien films about ? \nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \ni didn\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \nokay , so it isn\'t that good . \ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \noh yeah , and she\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \nand , of course , justin lazard . \nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \nsure , he is wooden , but isn\'t that what his character is like ? \nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\'s acting . \nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \nhell , i don\'t even know if i will . \nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \ni probably won\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful ," and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \"" jump ! \"" \nmoments ", and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the

'glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . \nbroderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . \nshaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . \nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . \nas the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . \nlike private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . \nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . \nsoon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . \nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . \nthe film periodically jumps between shaw\'s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . \nthe movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . \nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . \nhe is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . \nhis bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . \nwashington provides much of the film\'s intensity and emotional power . \nin one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . \nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . \nit makes your blood boil . \nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington\'s cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn\'t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman\'s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw\'s close childhood friends . \nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man ," prompting washington to nickname him \"" snow flake . \"" \nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships ", but somehow they never lose their morale . \nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \nunfortunately , however , broderick\'s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \nthe film places too much weight on broderick\'s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \nto the contrary ," they are chaotic and horrifying ; it\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \"" thirtysomething \"" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \nin one scene ", for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \na couple of the movie\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \nthe regiment\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \n',pos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \nafter these credits ," a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \nthe narrator states that \"" this is the story of daryl gleason \"" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \nof course ", really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \nfor some reason , this genre\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \nstalked is no exception ( it\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \nstalked\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \nmaryam d\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) ," is equally adequate as the \"" stalked \"" of the title ", even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \nbrooke ( d\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \nto ensure he won\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \nof course not . \nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\'s intelligence . \nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \nif you\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it\'s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \nthat\'s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \nthey haven\'t spoken in years , and wouldn\'t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren\'t for kaisa\'s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn\'t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn\'t fallen very far from the tree . \nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \nain\'t they a pair ? \nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \nby the time they reach the hospital , it\'s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they\'re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \naberdeen doesn\'t know where else to go . \nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \nheadey\'s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she\'d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \nit\'s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter\'s captivating signs & wonders . \nit\'s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they\'re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \ndespite skarsg ? rd\'s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \nthere\'s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \nnossiter\'s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it\'s willing to stretch beyond what we\'ve come to expect from traditional drama . \naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan\'s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin\'s hollywood mogul pronounces ," \"" all of life\'s riddles are answered in the movies ! \"" \neven foreign films are taking that advice to heart . \n'",neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann\'s forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . \nusually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he\'s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach\'s hidden agenda . \ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \nhe\'s an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids\' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \nhe\'ll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \nhe\'s both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn\'t want to do . \nthis makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he\'s a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie\'s ill-advised foray into big john\'s haven . \nthere is unnecessary padding with howie\'s miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \nwe\'re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it\'s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . \nthe restraint is admirable . \nbut l . i . e . \'s screenplay doesn\'t always give them the best material . \nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach\'s goldberg variations . \nit\'s too much . \nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john\'s other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff\'s superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \nit\'s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \nin this regard , l . i . e . \n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \nhow often does real life work this way ? \nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . \nthis is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . \nit also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there ," too . \ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . \ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that\'s made the kennedy family so popular . \nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . \nshe soon learns why \"" easier said than done \"" is the mantra of movies like this . \nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland ", almost misses the bus to town , can\'t get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage ," and so on . \nthen comes what roger ebert calls the \"" meet cute . \"" \nit happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional ", cinematic way . \nin the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o\'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . \nno points for guessing it\'s the same dog that just made water on her luggage . \nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates o\'hara on sight . \nthat\'s how it works in movies like these . \ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she\'d hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they\'d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . \ni haven\'t mentioned the movie\'s twist yet . \ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . \nmilo o\'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . \nrest assured he\'ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o\'hara . \noh , and in keeping with the matchmaker\'s utter predictability , he dies toward the end . \nwhat the message here ? \nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . \ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . \nleary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . \nhe even undoes himself with the old microphone\'s still on after he\'s done giving the speech cliche . \nboth of them should have known better . \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn\'t pretty . \nthis time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas\'s the three musketeers . \nby bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . \nthe end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . \nthe story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . \nd\'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . \nhe travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . \nin paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu\'s man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . \nhe finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer\'s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king\'s prison . \nd\'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d\'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . \ndirector peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it\'s a disaster . \none problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . \njet li\'s high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . \nironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . \nmost asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . \nthe musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . \nchambers\' d\'artangnan isn\'t a musketeer -- he\'s a mouseketeer ! \nand hyam\'s use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that\'s the only standout in an overall flat production . \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \nfirst , there\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \nno no . . . \njust kidding . \nhad you going there for a moment , didn\'t i ? \nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \ni\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\'t try to overachieve . \nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \nshao khan has decided that he\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly ," and being just plain stupid . \none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \"" hey "," that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \"" \ntoo bad they didn\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture ", but here are the high points : \n * the acting is truly bad . \nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \nin the first movie ," christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \"" tiny \"" lister ", jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) ," and remar has always been one of my favorite \"" utility \"" actors but he\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important ", but then never seen again . \n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n . . . unless you\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n * in the fights ," each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \nsonya does her \"" kiss of death "," \"" jax does his \"" earthquake "," \"" liu kang does his \"" animality "," \"" and so on . \na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n * there aren\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first ", because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \nsilly , silly folks . \nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n * the special effects are generally better ," except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \"" animalities . \"" \nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games ", i give this a 5 . \nyou\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one .

'i\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too ," saying clueless is a good movie and that i\'m the only one who doesn\'t like it . \none girl said if i\'d seen the movie with \"" an open mind "," \"" i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i\'m crazymadinlove with alicia ", but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\'t me ) yelled out ," \"" that was the worst f$&#in\' movie i\'ve ever seen \"" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier ", the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\'s too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\'s taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can\'t call it a sex flick . \ni\'ve already pointed out that it can\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \nwell , whatever it is , you\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\'re left with here . \nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \nit\'s like i said . . . this \nmovie sucks . \nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \nuneven , would be another . \nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes ," all leading you to believe that it\'s actually going to go \"" somewhere \"" . \nbut it isn\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral ", features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet ," tries too hard to get us into the \"" pain \"" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \nin a sci-fi movie ? \nwell ", i don\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise ," joins the crew in their \"" misadventures in space \"" for the main crux of its journey ", and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \nof course , i don\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \nugh . \nwhat a friggin\' mess . \nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \ndidn\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \ndidn\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\'t saying much ! ) . \nof course , you can\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \n\'nuff said . \nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \nears hurt ! ) . \nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \nsure . \ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes ," the \"" sand-twister \"" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \nother than that ? \ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops "," \ndid i say \"" admire \"" "," i meant \"" am disgusted \"" ! \nall in all ", this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \nthere\'s a great movie ! \nand on a personal note , i think it\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
